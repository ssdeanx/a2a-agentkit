# Academic Research Agent

The Academic Research Agent specializes in scholarly investigation, peer-reviewed literature analysis, and rigorous academic methodology.

## Overview

This agent conducts comprehensive academic research by:

- **Scholarly Database Search**: Accessing academic databases, journals, and repositories
- **Citation Analysis**: Evaluating research impact and scholarly influence networks
- **Methodological Evaluation**: Assessing research design quality and statistical validity
- **Literature Synthesis**: Combining findings from peer-reviewed sources
- **Research Gap Analysis**: Identifying areas needing further scholarly investigation

## Agent Capabilities

- **Multi-Database Search**: Queries across PubMed, IEEE, JSTOR, Google Scholar, and Web of Science
- **Peer Review Assessment**: Evaluates publication quality and scholarly rigor
- **Citation Network Analysis**: Tracks research influence and citation patterns
- **Methodological Rigor**: Analyzes research design, validity, and statistical methods
- **Scholarly Synthesis**: Integrates findings across multiple academic disciplines

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI model access
- `ACADEMIC_RESEARCH_AGENT_PORT`: Port for the agent server (default: 41245)

### Dependencies

- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model with thinking capabilities
- A2A protocol for inter-agent communication

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

```bash
# From the project root
npm run agents:academic-research-agent
```

### Testing with CLI

```bash
# Connect to the academic research agent
npm run a2a:cli http://localhost:41245

# Example research request
"Analyze scholarly literature on artificial intelligence ethics"
```

## Research Methodology

### Database Selection

1. **Discipline-Specific**: PubMed (medicine), IEEE (engineering), JSTOR (humanities)
2. **Multidisciplinary**: Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus
3. **Specialized**: arXiv (preprints), SSRN (social sciences), bioRxiv (biology)

### Quality Assessment

- **Peer Review Status**: Verified peer-reviewed vs. preprint publications
- **Journal Metrics**: Impact factors, citation rates, editorial standards
- **Author Credentials**: Institutional affiliations and publication history
- **Methodological Rigor**: Research design quality and statistical validity

### Citation Analysis

- **Citation Counts**: Measures research influence and reach
- **Citation Networks**: Tracks how research builds upon previous work
- **h-index Analysis**: Evaluates researcher impact over time
- **Field-Normalized Metrics**: Compares impact within specific disciplines

## Output Format

The agent provides academic research results in structured JSON format including:

- **Literature Search**: Databases queried and search strategies used
- **Scholarly Findings**: Key studies organized by research area with full citations
- **Methodological Analysis**: Research design evaluation and quality assessment
- **Citation Analysis**: Research influence metrics and scholarly networks

## Integration Points

### Input Sources

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Receives research tasks requiring scholarly depth
- **Planning Agent**: Gets methodological requirements and quality thresholds
- **User Requests**: Accepts queries requiring academic rigor and evidence

### Output Destinations

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Provides peer-reviewed findings and methodological insights
- **Web Research Agent**: Supplies academic context for general web findings
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Delivers scholarly data for quantitative analysis

## Development Status

**Current Implementation**: Basic academic research framework with citation analysis and methodological evaluation.

**Next Steps**:

- Integrate with actual academic databases (PubMed API, IEEE Xplore, etc.)
- Implement citation network analysis and impact metrics
- Add preprint server monitoring (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv)
- Enhance methodological evaluation algorithms
- Develop field-specific research templates

## API Reference

### Agent Card Endpoint

```http
GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
```

Returns the agent's capabilities and supported operations.

### Task Execution

The agent accepts academic research requests and conducts scholarly investigations through the A2A task protocol.

## Error Handling

- **Database Access Issues**: Fallback to alternative academic resources
- **Citation Data Unavailable**: Estimation based on available metrics
- **Peer Review Status Uncertain**: Clear labeling of publication status
- **Cross-Disciplinary Challenges**: Appropriate database selection and search strategies

## Monitoring and Logging

- Console logging for database queries and citation analysis
- Progress updates published via A2A events
- Quality metrics and methodological assessment tracking
- Research completeness and coverage monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- **Real Database Integration**: Direct API connections to major academic databases
- **Citation Network Visualization**: Graphical representation of research connections
- **Research Trend Analysis**: Identification of emerging scholarly directions
