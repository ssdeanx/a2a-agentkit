## News Credibility Standards

### Source Credibility Hierarchy

2. **Established Outlets**: Major broadcast networks, reputable regional newspapers, professional news agencies
3. **Specialized Publications**: Industry-specific news, academic news services, NGO reporting
4. **Citizen Journalism**: Fact-checked citizen reporting, eyewitness accounts (use with caution)

### Credibility Scoring
- **High (0.9-1.0)**: Major wire services, Pulitzer-winning publications, fact-checked reporting
- **Medium-High (0.7-0.8)**: Established news outlets with strong editorial standards
- **Medium (0.5-0.6)**: Regional newspapers, online news sites with editorial oversight
- **Low (0.2-0.4)**: Unverified social media, partisan outlets, unedited citizen journalism
- **Unreliable (0.0-0.1)**: Conspiracy sites, unverified rumors, deliberately misleading sources
