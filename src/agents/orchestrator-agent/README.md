# Research Orchestrator Agent

The Research Orchestrator Agent coordinates complex multi-agent research workflows, managing research state, optimizing task distribution, and ensuring high-quality research outcomes through intelligent agent coordination.

## Overview

This agent serves as the central coordinator for the Deep Research Agent system, responsible for:

- **Research State Management**: Tracking progress across all research phases
- **Task Coordination**: Assigning research steps to appropriate specialized agents
- **Progress Monitoring**: Detecting bottlenecks and triggering contingency plans
- **Quality Assurance**: Validating research outputs against quality thresholds
- **Resource Optimization**: Balancing parallel execution with dependency management

## Agent Capabilities

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrates web-research, academic-research, news-research, and data-analysis agents
- **State Persistence**: Maintains research state across execution sessions
- **Dynamic Task Assignment**: Assigns tasks based on agent availability and expertise
- **Quality Control**: Monitors output quality and triggers re-execution when needed
- **Contingency Management**: Handles agent failures and resource constraints

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI model access
- `ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_PORT`: Port for the agent server (default: 41243)

### Dependencies

- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model with thinking capabilities
- A2A protocol for inter-agent communication
- Shared interfaces from `../shared/interfaces.ts`

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

```bash
# From the project root
npm run agents:orchestrator-agent
```

### Testing with CLI

```bash
# Connect to the orchestrator agent
npm run a2a:cli http://localhost:41243

# Example orchestration request
"Execute this research plan and coordinate with specialized research agents"
```

## Agent Architecture

### Core Components

- **OrchestratorAgentExecutor**: Main execution logic for research coordination
- **State Management**: In-memory research state tracking (to be enhanced with persistence)
- **Task Distribution**: Intelligent assignment of research steps to agents
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of research execution

### Research Phases

1. **Planning**: Receive and validate research plans from planning agent
2. **Execution**: Coordinate parallel execution across research agents
3. **Synthesis**: Combine findings from multiple research streams
4. **Validation**: Cross-verify results and ensure quality thresholds
5. **Reporting**: Finalize research outputs and generate reports

## Integration Points

### Input Sources

- **Planning Agent**: Receives detailed research plans with execution steps
- **User Requests**: Accepts orchestration commands and research objectives
- **Status Updates**: Receives progress updates from executing research agents

### Output Destinations

- **Research Agents**: Sends task assignments and receives results
- **Planning Agent**: Provides orchestration feedback and issues
- **User Interface**: Publishes progress updates and final results

## Development Status

**Current Implementation**: Basic orchestration framework with state management and task coordination.

**Next Steps**:

- Implement inter-agent communication via A2A protocol
- Add persistent state storage
- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Integrate with all research agent types

## API Reference

### Agent Card Endpoint

```http
GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
```

Returns the agent's capabilities and supported operations.

### Task Execution

The agent accepts orchestration requests and manages research execution through the A2A task protocol.

## Error Handling

- **Agent Failures**: Automatic retry with different agents or fallback strategies
- **Quality Issues**: Re-execution of failed tasks with adjusted parameters
- **Resource Constraints**: Load balancing and rate limit management
- **Dependency Issues**: Parallel execution optimization and deadlock prevention

## Monitoring and Logging

- Console logging for orchestration decisions and state changes
- Progress updates published via A2A events
- Error tracking with automatic issue escalation
- Performance metrics for optimization insights

## Future Enhancements

- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration for long-term state management
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Machine learning-based task prioritization
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user research session support
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed execution metrics and optimization
- **Custom Workflows**: Configurable research pipelines and templates
