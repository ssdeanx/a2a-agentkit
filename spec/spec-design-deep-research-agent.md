## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements and design for transforming the existing Movie Agent into a comprehensive Deep Research Agent. The Deep Research Agent will provide thorough, evidence-based research capabilities across multiple domains, replacing the movie-specific functionality with general-purpose research tools and methodologies.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This specification outlines the transformation of the Movie Agent component within the A2A AgentKit from a TMDB-based movie information system to a general-purpose deep research agent. The scope includes architectural changes, new tool integrations, prompt engineering modifications, and interface updates to support comprehensive research across any topic.

The specification is intended for AI coding assistants and developers implementing the transformation. It assumes familiarity with the existing A2A AgentKit architecture and TypeScript development practices.

## 2. Definitions

                                               └─────────────────────┘
                                                            ↓
Orchestrator Agent ← Aggregated Results ← Quality Validation ← Synthesis
                                                            ↓
                                                    Final Research Report

## 7. Rationale & Context

### Design Decisions

The transformation from Movie Agent to Deep Research Agent addresses the limitation of domain-specific functionality by creating a general-purpose research system. The original movie agent was constrained to TMDB data and film-related queries, which limited its utility.

**Multi-Agent Architecture Decision**: Rather than a monolithic research agent, the system implements specialized agents (Planning, Orchestrator, Research Execution) to enable:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of research
- **Scalability**: Individual agents can be upgraded or replaced independently
- **Reliability**: Failure in one agent doesn't compromise the entire research process
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific agents can optimize for their particular research type

**Planning-First Approach**: Research begins with comprehensive planning to:

- **Reduce Trial-and-Error**: Structured methodology prevents inefficient research patterns
- **Resource Optimization**: Pre-calculated data sources and methods minimize API calls and processing time
- **Quality Assurance**: Risk assessment and contingency planning ensure research completeness
- **User Transparency**: Detailed plans provide clear expectations and progress tracking

**Orchestration Layer**: The orchestrator provides:

- **Coordination**: Manages complex inter-agent communication and data flow
- **State Management**: Maintains research context across distributed operations
- **Quality Control**: Validates results and implements fallback strategies
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time updates on multi-step research processes

### Architectural Considerations

- **Multi-Source Research**: Single data sources provide incomplete information; multiple sources enable comprehensive analysis
- **Evidence-Based Responses**: Citations and source verification build trust and allow result validation
- **Streaming Architecture**: Long research tasks benefit from real-time progress updates
- **Artifact Generation**: Structured outputs enable better result consumption and sharing
- **Agent Communication**: A2A protocol enables reliable inter-agent coordination and state synchronization
- **Fault Tolerance**: Multi-agent design allows graceful degradation when individual components fail

### Technology Choices

- **Genkit Framework**: Maintains consistency with existing A2A AgentKit architecture
- **Gemini AI Models**: Provides advanced reasoning capabilities for research analysis
- **A2A Protocol**: Ensures interoperability with other agents in the ecosystem

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### Basic Research Query

```typescript

// Expected Output: Comprehensive analysis with citations from EPA, academic studies, and manufacturer data
```

### Complex Multi-Part Research

```typescript
// Input: "Compare the economic impact of remote work before and after COVID-19"
// Expected Output: Structured report with pre-COVID baseline, COVID impact analysis, and post-COVID trends
```

### Edge Cases

- **Empty Query**: Agent should request clarification
- **Ambiguous Topic**: Agent should ask for topic refinement
- **Contradictory Sources**: Agent should present all viewpoints with evidence
- **Time-Sensitive Research**: Agent should prioritize recent sources
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Agent should gracefully handle API rate limits

### Error Handling Examples

```typescript
// Network timeout during research
// Expected: Partial results with clear indication of incomplete research
